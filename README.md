In Q1, for constant input current I always got a positive membrane potential but for sinusoidal input current I even got negative values of membrane potential. 
The firing frequency vs input current graph was a concave curve saturating for higher values of input current.
In Q2, the model showed insignificant results at 10,000 epochs and showed significant results only at epochs of order 5.
